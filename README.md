# Julia + Node.js + Xterm.js + React.js

Implementation of Julia console on the web.

## Instructions

First install all the necessary dependencies `npm install` on `server` and `client` folders.

Then, simply run 

```sh
npm run start
``` 

on both `server` and `client` folders.

There is also a simple script called `RUN.dev.sh` where you can run both servers with one command.

> For watching changes in the `server` you can instead run `npm run watch` to run a `nodemon` instance.
